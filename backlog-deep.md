# Grooming a DEEP Backlog

The esteemed Agile evanglist, Mike Cohn from (www.mountaingoatsoftware.com), has coined the acronym, DEEP, as a way to summarize what he believes are the key attributes of a successful Feature Backlog.


* <b>Detailed Appropriately:</b> following the concept of adpactive planning, users stories at the top of a prioritized Backlog should be more sufficiently documented and understood than lower prioritized stories, so that they can be completed in the current of upcoming iteration.
* <b>Emergent:</b> a well groomed Backlog changes over time to reflect to deeper understanding of the product requirements or the changing environment shaping the characteristics of the project.
* <b>Estimated:</b> well understood user stories are critical to providing accurate estimates, which makes it possible to use the Backlog as an effective planning and communicating component of an Agile project.
* <b>Prioritized:</b> Backlog grooming constantly ensuring the highest value user stories are at the top, making it possible for the team to always be delivering value to the customer.
