# Decorating Your User Stories

Imagine you are building a website that will allow users to sign up for a new service.  The service will provide access to a certain sub-set of features to annonymous users.  Users that create a free account will gain access to more features than the annonymous users.  Maybe there is even a premium level to the service which requires users with accounts to enter a credit card and subscribe.  Just from this very brief scenario, we can see that not all visitors to the website are equal, yet at times, the distinction between them may be subtle.  This could be a good opportunity to enhance the quality of the user stories by decorating the website users with helpful decorations.

In this case, we have website visitors.  It is almost certain that all visitors will start out as annonymous users, meaning, they haven't created an account yet.  Even more generally, we can add an even more subtle distinction here, with first-time annonymous visitors vs. repeat annonymous visitors.  This simple decoration can help to provide additional information about feature requirements without having to provide a lengthy explanation about what is different about this user from an annonymous repeat visitor.

From here, each new feature requirement that is developed can expand upon these user decorations: New Free Account users, New Premium Account user, etc. can all be easily understood and provide a bit more richness to the user stories.  These user decorations can be seen as a way to avoid creating a large number of very similar archtypal user scenarios, or personas.  When the sub-set of exposed functionality changes only minimally (and perhaps linearly) between a set of your users, then decorations can save time over mroe detailed personas.

However, if there are substantial differences between the features exposed to your various user types, crafting distinct personas into which your users can fit may be the more appropriate option.
