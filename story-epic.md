# EPIC User Stories and How to Use Them

Sometimes, large users stories are unavoidable when gathering the stakeholder requirements and developing the product roadmap.  As a general rule-of-thumb, a large user stories suggest the lack of a deep understanding of a particular requirement.  However, sometimes a feature can be complex enough that even after a thorough decomposition of the steps involved to produce the feature has been done, the Level of Effort identified may span more than 1 Iteration.  In this case, an Epic User Story is required.  There is no official definition for how large a story must be before it is considered Epic, so it may be left up to the project team to decide just how big an Epic is.  This may vary from team to team or project to project.

By simply labeling a user story as Epic, the team is communicating something about the feature represented by the story.  It should be clear to anyone who reviews the Product Roadmap or the Feature Backlog that special consideration must be given to produce the Epic.  This should help with tasks such as fearture prioritization and risk-adjusting when the Feature Backlog is being groomed.
