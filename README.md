# Create a new agile project.

Use this process outline to help you kick-off a new Agile based project in a standardized and consistent manner.  Customize the outline as necessary to tailor the process to fit the needs of your organization or project.  Using this outline for each new project will help create a consistent practice and ensure all team members are familiar and comfortable in their roles.  It is not necessary to follow the process in the exact order the steps are presented in, but it tries to create a logical progression from less to more detail.  

* Process Tailoring:
  * Define the Project Management approach for the project
    * communicate, clearly and early, what methodologies are to be used:
	  - Kanban
	  - Scrum
	  - XP, etc.
	* Define and communicate the Project Management process requirements.
* Define the Minimally Marketable Feature/Product (MMF/P):
  * Clearly establish the measure of functionality that is complete enough to be useful to the users, yet small enough to fit into the planned Iteration/Sprint concept.
* Value-Based Analysis:
  * Define how value will be determined and measured.
  * Consider developement costs and business values.
    - Present Value and Net Present Value
	- Internal Rate of Return
	- Return on Investment
  * Determine the payback frequency, if necessary.
* Value-Based Decomposition and Prioritization:
  * elicit requirements from stakeholders
    - determine requirements gathering method:
	  - focus groups
	  - surveys
	  - feature workshops, etc.
	- determine method used to prioritize the established requirements and features:
	  - Remember the Future
	  - Prune the Product Tree
	  - Speedboat
	  - Buy a Feature
	  - Bang-for-the-Buck
* Estimating:
  * Level of Effort
    - determine LoE estimating method to use:
	  - Ideal Time
	  - Wideband Delphi
	  - Planning Poker
	- Story Points and Relative Sizing 
	  - team activity: create definition for the value of a story point
	  - team activity: create definition for 'done'
	  - team activity: begin affinity estimating for existing requirements 
    - Budget and Costs
	  - Aggregate the LoE by:
	    - Story Points or
		- Ideal Days
	  - Convert aggregate LoE into a a schedule
	    - factor in team size
		- required resources and availability
		- other dependencies
	  - Aggregate costs over the schedule
	    - unburdend or burdened costs (see (burdened-costs.md))
