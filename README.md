# Create a new agile project.

Use this process outline to help you kick-off a new Agile based project in a standardized and consistent manner.  Customize the outline as necessary to tailor the process to fit the needs of your organization or project.  Using this outline for each new project will help create a consistent practice and ensure all team members are familiar and comfortable in their roles.  It is not necessary to follow the process in the exact order the steps are presented in, but it tries to create a logical progression from less to more detail.  

### Feasibility
To be honest, many projects lack a formal feasibility process. There are plenty of reasons for this, and some common reasons include: the feasibility work has already been done, the project is considered too small to warrant this level of inspection, or the project team lacks the necessary skills of a business analyst.  While projects may certainly succeed despite a lack of a feasibility study, it is a good process to consider and gets easier with practice.  

Feasibility in Agile is very similar to what is done in Traditional project management.  The main difference is that the documentation tends to be lighter.  The same calculations are used: IRR, ROI, and NPV.

* Create the business case
  * establish the high-level estimates
    * [calculate-value.md](Return On Investment)
      * At what income value does this occur?
      * How long is the projected payback period?
    * [calculate-value.md](Net Present Value)
      * What is the expected future value of this project today?
    * [calculate-value.md](Internal Rate of Return)
      * useful for choosing between proposed projects when resources are constrained
* Create the project vision
  * a group activity with the stakeholders
    * facilitates faster decision making and trust
    * provides team with a mantra, metaphor and motivation

### Process Tailoring

  * Define the Project Management approach for the project
    * communicate, clearly and early, what methodologies are to be used:
	  - Kanban
	  - Scrum
	  - XP
	  - Feature Driven Development
	  - Crystal
	  - Lean Software Development
	* Define and communicate the Project Management process requirements.
* Define the Minimally Marketable Feature/Product (MMF/P):
  * Clearly establish the measure of functionality that is complete enough to be useful to the users, yet small enough to fit into the planned Iteration/Sprint concept.
* Value-Based Analysis:
  * Define how value will be determined and measured.
  * Consider developement costs and business values.
    - Present Value and Net Present Value
	- Internal Rate of Return
	- Return on Investment
  * Determine the payback frequency, if necessary.
* Value-Based Decomposition and Prioritization:
  * elicit requirements from stakeholders
    - determine requirements gathering method:
	  - focus groups
	  - surveys
	  - feature workshops, etc.
	- determine method used to prioritize the established requirements and features:
	  - Remember the Future
	  - Prune the Product Tree
	  - Speedboat
	  - Buy a Feature
	  - Bang-for-the-Buck
* Estimating:
  * Level of Effort
    - determine LoE estimating method to use:
	  - Ideal Time
	  - Wideband Delphi
	  - Planning Poker
	- Story Points and Relative Sizing 
	  - team activity: create definition for the value of a story point
	  - team activity: create definition for 'done'
	  - team activity: begin affinity estimating for existing requirements 
    - Budget and Costs
	  - Aggregate the LoE by:
	    - Story Points or
		- Ideal Days
	  - Convert aggregate LoE into a a schedule
	    - factor in team size
		- required resources and availability
		- other dependencies
	  - Aggregate costs over the schedule
	    - unburdend or burdened costs (see [burdened costs](burdened-costs.md))
* Create the Project Plan
  * Propose the milestone goals
  * Propose the release goals
  * Iteration plans
   - establish iteration plans
   - backlog grooming habits
   - risk assesments
	 - establish how risks will be quantified (EMV, time loss)
     - create a risk-adjusted backlog
