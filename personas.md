# Establishing Your Product Personas

Writing personas should not be a complicated tasks.  At their core, personas are simply archetypal accounts of the types of users (or customers) you expect to use your product.  Personas are often described as quick reminders of the key stakeholders of the project and their interests.  They should be grounded in reality, agreed-upon and understood by the project team.  The goal of including personas as part of the requirements gathering process is to help generate focus on the relevant, specific and actionable aspects of the product, from the perspective of the users.  Personas can help to generate discussion among team members when there is a lack of clarity on how to interpret requirements.
